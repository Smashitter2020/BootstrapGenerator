# BootstrapGenerator
A tool used to generate components and utilities quickly without taking it too much time, unlike MDBootstrap, allowing to view code, customize styles, and view classes like buttons, offcanvas, and dropdowns.

## Get started 
Choose a component like buttons, or a class, and customize anything like colors. It will appear, and then copy the code into your file. You can use text fields such as choosing a button name.
